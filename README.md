# Jetpack Larry

My [JS1024](https://js1024.fun/results/2021) code golf entry. I won second place overall!

The final JS weighed in at [1023 bytes](https://github.com/andrewb/jetpack-larry/blob/main/min.js). See [index.js](https://github.com/andrewb/jetpack-larry/blob/main/index.js) for the uncompressed source. If you want to know more about how the sprites were coded, see my article about [run length encoding](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/having-fun-with-run-length-encoded-sprites-662d6a8147c8).
